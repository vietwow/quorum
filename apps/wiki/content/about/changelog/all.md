- The component palette now offers Search Engine, Object Storage, Queue, Worker, and a CDN component with adjustable TTL and WAF paranoia levels. Drag these parts onto the board and watch queue depth and egress burn. ([37aa546](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/37aa54655e9d4ff10ae22d5b3848cc00674ade03))
- A Team panel appears in the HUD, displaying Dev Hours from the Founder and Engineers, the Feature backlog, and available deploy slots. Open the panel to assign work and track progress. ([86f50f2](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/86f50f28b78f178d9c48ac3777dea8f4dbe1ebd6))
- Undo and Redo buttons sit on the toolbar, letting you step back or forward without changing Cash. The Tradeoff card displays a preview ghost and a Settling ring that fills as the simulation stabilises. ([88e25d0](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/88e25d0890c938e59c18c35704139ae69a10add1))
- Research appears as a tech tree with coloured shape badges for Edge, Compute, Data, and Ops tracks, plus a progress bar that fills as Insight accumulates. Click a node to open a side pane showing its description and prerequisites. ([1e58def](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/1e58def7eedbd4565f399987deea6acb3e7618fc))

### Changed

- Cards lift slightly when you drag them, snap to the grid with a subtle shadow, and show a coloured ring when selected. Links glow when created and fade out when cut, accompanied by subtle sound cues. ([c12e736](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/c12e736e67144717b315aebe9e6730c33ed3b0ce))
- Links appear as straight right-angle pipes that bend softly, thickening with traffic volume and tinting by packet type. Backward links route under cards for a clearer layout. ([b8ae307](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/b8ae307527fdddf943f36693d412edc9dfe5bb4a))

### Fixed

- Runtime names on App Server cards truncate with an ellipsis, and components lacking a framework show a dash instead of blank space, preventing overlap of UI elements. ([a23c746](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/a23c746d2fe5dd550dd8f8da9c246928e7af2531))

### Changed

- When an incident starts, the simulation clock slows to normal speed so you have time to react, and the failure hint now says “Select it and click Replace.” ([91fb61f](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/91fb61fbab4a340dd817b9d6a20f1a59e07392b4))
- The HUD displays the hour-averaged Apdex and its target; the Users card shows that Apdex value, and latency appears in seconds with millisecond precision. ([433d8de](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/433d8dedb68ee92458bffb99e4dc08ac80a9fe52))
- On the title screen, cables thread through the gaps between plates, request packets travel along each cable’s centerline beneath the machines, and the menu cable joint aligns with the new lead height. ([07468fa](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/07468fab7dc649365b583341992d9273b8d29512))
- The title screen builds a bench in real time: plates drop and land with shock outlines, request packets glide across the floating bench, and the dark night-shift theme lifts machines as you hover over menu options. ([ee8393f](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/ee8393f169b54b647f211c5bea0895770a277459))
- Press any button and feel feedback; the dock tray, inspector, panels, alerts, toasts, and card transitions now enter smoothly, while reduced-motion mode retains simple fades. ([53bdffe](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/53bdffe84f2e41292a66616ebef09b2033630a33))
- The HUD transforms into an icon-first toolbar with a stat stack; secondary UI sections remain folded until you open them, node cards show icons next to their labels, and buttons adopt the Geist font with a raised 3D fill. ([e267fce](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/e267fce1ae68a8bef1b99b428411c18f4d7450a5))
- The UI switches to the Graphite palette, near-neutral greys, primary ink, and four depth elevations, and the progress bar displays its fill width. ([01a6835](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/01a6835519699bbb792cd789ff126f5c6e260d4a))
- Component illustrations now use a consistent blueprint style across the game. ([6ebfb87](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/6ebfb87347beb1c7ef5c9bbe7e7a504ea78688ef))

### Added

- On the title screen you see a hero banner, four action buttons and a session note that act as the main menu. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992), [280ab9e](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/280ab9e8f5df886351e0b575dba23aa21ee7f6bc))
- When you start a Run you move to the run canvas, the month clock starts, and the tick counter resets to the start of the month. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992))
- When the month reaches its final tick you are taken to the report screen, ending the run. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992))
- If you enter an invalid four-character room code a rejection toast appears; a valid code opens the lobby and shows the available seats. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992))
- When you open the Tradeoff overlay your design choice is recorded, the month clock pauses, and it resumes when you close the overlay. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992), [768522b](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/768522b39162811c21d2f300bab73496f35ecec2))
- Toast messages disappear automatically after a short delay, keeping the screen clear. ([8c075c1](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/8c075c1ba32d78bdb3da4100af0d0ce7a9b14992))
- On the design canvas nodes, links and packets animate; drag to pan and use the mouse wheel to zoom. ([c5ce6ec](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/c5ce6eca7d43f30fa42e6f97b08805dca5df4374))
- On the run screen you see a header HUD with Capital, Burn, load, p95, errors and speed controls, metric charts, a ledger table, and pause and Tradeoff overlays. ([c18ded8](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/c18ded8aeca262c3387eed8c027529174f6095bb), [280ab9e](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/commit/280ab9e8f5df886351e0b575dba23aa21ee7f6bc))
